Weather App GUI ‚òÄÔ∏èüåßÔ∏è

The Weather App is a Java-based application that allows users to access real-time weather information for any specified location. It fetches data from an external weather API and presents key weather details such as temperature, weather conditions, humidity, and wind speed. The app features a graphical user interface (GUI) where users can input a location and view up-to-date weather information.

Technologies Used
Java 18: Core programming language for building the app.
JSON Simple: Used for parsing and reading JSON data from the weather API.
HTTPURLConnection: Java's built-in library for making HTTP requests to external APIs.
